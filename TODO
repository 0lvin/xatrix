Maps with broken single player spawn point:
 - None :)

Maps with broken coop spawnpoints:
 - xware: The info_player_start is at the same place as the first
          info_coop_start. So the second player is placed in the same
          place as the first one... This only happens when the map is
          loaded by console, not when entering from xreactor. Possible
          solutions: 1) mapquirk, move the first info_coop_start out
          of the way. 2) logic quirk, simulate entering from xreactor.
 - xship: Has only one info_player_start and no info_coop_start. The
          solution is to synthesize 3 info_coop_start by map quirks,
          but there's hardly any room for them...
